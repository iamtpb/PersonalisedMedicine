    "Exploring this NOTE by Iker (Kaggle):\n\t\"You should definitely use the 'Gene' and 'Variation' as part of your input features. This information is key for this challenge.\n",
    "\t A gene can have thousands of different point mutations. Some of them matter for a specific type of cancer, e.g. EGFR for Breast Cancer, and some others don't matter at all. A point mutation just represent a nucleotide change, there is an adenine (A) where there should be a cytosine (C) for instance. And these can happen in multiple genes as well.\n",
    "\t But a pair of Gene and Variation, define a set of specific genomic coordinates. For instance, PIK3CA, H1047R, means that if you pick the gene PIK3CA and start counting from the beginning. The codon (triplets of nucleotides) number 1047, Histidine is changed to a Arginine\n",
    "\t Therefore, a gene name or a variation name can be repeated in multiple rows, both in the training and the test sets. A Gene and Variation pair is unique and only appears once across both data sets\n",
